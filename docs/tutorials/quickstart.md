The detailed information about the fields are given below:
    1. **Name [Mandatory]** is the name of the bot. It should be the name of class for your bot code mentioned below. For this example, use `CarWashDealerFSM`.
    2. **Code [Mandatory]** is the fsm.py file python code. Copy the contents of [python file](car_wash.py) and paste it.
    3. **version [Mandatory]** - version of the bot. Put `1.0.0`.
    4. **required_credentials [Mandatory]** - Credentials required by the bot to access various external services. Here the FSM depends on `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`,`AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`,`AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` so put these keys in this section seperated by comma.
    5. Click on `Install` button.
    
3. Once the bot is created, click on the **settings (⚙) icon** to enter the given credentials values and click save to save the credentials values. For this example, put the values of `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION` and `AZURE_OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT`.

6. Start a new shell session and start ngrok on your system 
    ```bash
    $ ngrok http 8000
    ```
7. Copy the tunnel url from the ngrok shell.

8. Add this url to register the callback URL for Whatsapp service provider. Your callback url will look like this `<Tunnel URL>/callback`. 

    For this tutorial, we are using the shell script to add the callback URL. Run the script on a new shell session with the appropriate values to register the callback URL.

    ```bash
    #!/bin/bash

    WEBHOOK_URL="<Webhook url here>"
    WA_API_HOST="<API host here>"
    WABA_NUMBER="<Whatsapp business account number>"
    WA_API_KEY="<API Key here>"

    BODY='{"webhook_url": "'$WEBHOOK_URL'"}'
    echo $BODY

    curl -k "$WA_API_HOST/v1/setwebhooks" \
    --header "wanumber: $WABA_NUMBER" \
    --header "apikey: $WA_API_KEY" \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data-raw "$BODY"
    ```
9. Your bot is running. Send a `Hi` message to whatsapp business number to start conversation with the bot.
